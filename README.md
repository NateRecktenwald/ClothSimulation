# ClothSimulation
Creates a cloth material that will swing with gravity. Constructed a cloth object by connecting points of mass using an elastic string given a spring constant to allow for contraction and expansion. Then the cloth is simulated using physics equations by dropping the object from a starting height while pining one end of the cloth still.
